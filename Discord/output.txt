[2021-02-15 01:21] <Fence-Dro#0736> The stuff we are doing visibly in this server right now is us getting the other startups to that level.
[2021-02-15 01:20] <Fence-Dro#0736> No, thanks for asking. We need to clear this up.
[2021-02-15 01:20] <Fence-Dro#0736> Most of those startups communicate outside of this server. We find that communicating with companies like that or larger in discord doesn't work as well as using more mainstream forms of business communication.

[2021-02-15 01:17] <Fence-Dro#0736> The startups that we connect to investors must have patentable technology and revenue of upwards of 10k annually. For equity buyouts, our requirement is just a revenue of over 10k annually.
[2021-02-15 01:13] <ichigo kurosaki#5831> also Imran sent me here saying y'all help startups meet investors and stuff like that but from what i see thats not what y'all do
[2021-02-15 00:52] <Fence-Dro#0736> Not necessary
[2021-02-15 00:52] <Fence-Dro#0736> Ok, no problem. They just want people do sell it. Not formal.
[2021-02-15 00:25] <ichigo kurosaki#5831> hey guys not a dropshipper btw
[2021-02-14 18:30] <Fence-Dro#0736> Sounds awesome. Will do.
